## cardKeeper

### Problem

When working on video projects, you require to keep a log of cards,
if they have been backup to the computer / system, and if they have been assessembled.

Normally this is all done on a paper print out, or table on computer, which risks getting lost,
damaged, editing of data by videographers, and possibly countinous counts of numbers.

### Solution

Build a web based system, with the possibility of user authentication.
Give the editors a seperate page to mark if the card has been 'wrangled' (backed up), and if it has been assessembled.

Give the videographers the ability to add cards, giving a breif description, then receive the card number for that card.

### So far

I have started work on this, and the basis exist, I just require to test it, and then do some better design.
